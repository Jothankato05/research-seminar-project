## Reporting a Vulnerability

As V-CTRIP is a cybersecurity platform developed for a research seminar, we take security very seriously.

If you find a security vulnerability, please **DO NOT** open a public issue. Issues are public and could lead to exploitation of installations.

Please report any security concerns directly to the project maintainers via the contact information provided in the research seminar documentation.

### What to include in a report:
- A brief description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Potential impact if exploited.

We aim to acknowledge and address all reports within 48 hours.
