# Contributing to V-CTRIP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Veritas Cyber Threat Reporting & Intelligence Platform (V-CTRIP). As a research seminar project, we value academic rigor and secure coding practices.

## 🛡️ Security First

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**. Instead, please report it privately to the project maintainers.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/research-seminar-project.git
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```
4. **Implement your changes** following the project's coding standards.
5. **Ensure your code passes linting**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run lint
   cd ../frontend && npm run lint
   ```
6. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: Descriptive message about the change"
   ```
7. **Push to your fork** and **open a Pull Request**.

## 📝 Coding Standards

- Use **TypeScript** for both Frontend and Backend.
- Follow the **NestJS** architectural patterns (Controllers, Services, Modules).
- Use **TailwindCSS** for UI components.
- Document all new API endpoints in the `README.md` or a separate `API.md`.

## 📜 Academic Integrity

As this is part of a Research Seminar, please ensure that all contributions are original work. If you use external libraries or reference existing research, provide proper attribution.
